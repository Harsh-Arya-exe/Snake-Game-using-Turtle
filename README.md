# 🐢 Turtle Python Game

A simple yet engaging game built using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics library. This project is a personal milestone— I wanted to create something entirely on my own, without following any video tutorials or step-by-step guides. The goal was to explore, experiment, and learn by building, and this game is the result of that process.
